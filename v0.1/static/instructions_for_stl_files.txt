# Instructions for Adding STL Files to the 3D Hero Section

Follow these steps to add your own STL files to the rotating 3D display in the hero section:

## 1. Prepare Your STL Files

- Make sure your STL files are in ASCII format (binary STL files may also work)
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB recommended for web performance)
- Ensure models have a clean topology and appropriate triangle count
- Test your models in a 3D viewer before uploading

## 2. Add Files to the Static Directory

- Place your STL files in the `/v0.1/static/models/` folder
- Example file path: `/v0.1/static/models/your_model.stl`

## 3. Update the Model List in the 3D Hero Script

- Open `/v0.1/static/js/3d_hero.js`
- Find the `modelList` array (around line 130)
- Add a new entry for your STL file with this format:

```javascript
{
    type: 'stl',
    url: '/static/models/your_model.stl',  // Path to your file
    color: 0x4CAF50,                      // Hex color (0x followed by hex code)
    displayName: 'Your Model Name'         // Display name shown in the UI
}
```

Example of a complete model list with a new file:

```javascript
const modelList = [
    { 
        type: 'stl',
        url: '/static/models/sample_print.stl',
        color: 0x4CAF50,
        displayName: 'Sample Print'
    },
    { 
        type: 'stl',
        url: '/static/models/your_model.stl',  // Your new model
        color: 0xFF5722,                      // Orange color
        displayName: 'Your Cool Model'         // Name that appears in UI
    },
    // Other models...
];
```

## 4. Customizing Model Appearance

You can customize how your model appears:

- `color`: Change the hex color (use 0x followed by a hex color code)
- `displayName`: Set the name that appears in the UI badge

## 5. Model Positioning and Scaling

The code automatically:
- Centers models based on their geometry
- Scales models to a reasonable size
- Positions models above the printing platform

If your model appears too small or large, you can adjust the scaling factor in the `loadSTLModel` function:
- Find `const scaleFactor = 3 / maxDim;` (around line 250)
- Increase the number 3 for larger models, decrease for smaller models

## 6. Testing Your Models

- Restart the Django server if it's already running
- Visit the home page to see your 3D models
- Models will rotate every 10 seconds
- Check browser console (F12) for any loading errors
- If your model doesn't appear, try the other debugging tips below

## Troubleshooting

If your models don't appear:
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Verify file paths are correct and files exist in the specified location
- Try converting binary STL files to ASCII format
- Reduce model complexity for better performance
- Set `DEBUG = true` in 3d_hero.js to see detailed logs
- Add more debug visualizations with the provided debug helpers
